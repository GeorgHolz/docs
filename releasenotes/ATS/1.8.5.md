## Compatibiliy to Mendix 7
ATS now supports testing the recently released Mendix 7.

## Improvements
* Improved the performance of the project dashboard. Loading time should now be much faster.
* Removed the log depth setting for schedules to avoid log flooding. The setting is still available for manual test runs.

## Fixes
* The error logs now show correct timestamps with "UTC" suffix.
* Fixed two scenarios, where the results of data-driven test cases were not counted correctly on the dashboard and in the report.
* Fixed a bug on the project dashboard where the "Show log" button would not show the correct execution log for a data-driven test case.
* Fixed a bug on the project dashboard where the "Show log" button would not show the execution log for  test suites.
* Fixed the PDF report generation on the project dashboard which crashed in case the descriptions in test cases/suites were too long.
* Fixed the bug in the repository where it wasn't possible to add multiple items one after another because the "add item" function would work once.
* Added a validation for test cases to prevent empty names.
* Added a validation to schedules so that you can't save a schedule without selecting your Selenium server.
* Removed the naming restriction on projects so that projects in different tenants can have the same name.
